Polyglot is a Middleware between the Universal Devices ISY Home Automation device and any number of external devices and services.

This a Docker Image that is build nightly

For those using UNRAID here the template I'm using in UNRAID - Unraid-Polyglot-V2-Template.xml. It also required that you run MongoDB in another Docker in my case named udi-polyglotv2-MongoDB. I'm using the offical MongoDB docker from Community Plugin.
