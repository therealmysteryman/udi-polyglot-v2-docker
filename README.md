Polyglot is a Middleware between the Universal Devices ISY Home Automation device and any number of external devices and services.

This a Docker Image that is build nightly and required that you have a running MongoDB docker running.

For those using UNRAID here the template I'm using in UNRAID - Unraid-Polyglot-V2-Template.xml. It also required that you run MongoDB (using MongoDB Docker from Community Plugins) in another Docker in my case it named udi-polyglotv2-MongoDB.
