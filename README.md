Polyglot V2 is a Middleware between the Universal Devices ISY Home Automation device and any number of external devices and services.
From https://github.com/Einstein42/udi-polyglotv2

This Docker Image is build nightly and required that you have a Docker running MongoDB. https://hub.docker.com/r/automationgeek/udi-polyglot-v2-docker/

I have included the Unraid Template for those using Unraid, you can use the template in Unraid. https://github.com/therealmysteryman/udi-polyglot-v2-docker/Polyglot-V2-Unraid-Template.xml It also required that you run MongoDB (using MongoDB Docker from Community Plugins) in another Docker in my case I named it udi-polyglotv2-MongoDB.
