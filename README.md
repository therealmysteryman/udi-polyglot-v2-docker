Polyglot V2 is a Middleware between the Universal Devices ISY Home Automation device and any number of external devices and services.
From https://github.com/Einstein42/udi-polyglotv2

This Docker Image is build nightly and required that you have a Docker running MongoDB. ( https://hub.docker.com/r/automationgeek/udi-polyglot-v2-docker/ )

I have included the Unraid Template for those using Unraid, you can use the template in Unraid, the only requirement is that you have a Docker Image. ( https://github.com/therealmysteryman/udi-polyglot-v2-docker/Polyglot-V2-Unraid-Template.xml )

For those using Unraid here the template I'm using Polyglot-V2-Unraid-Template.xml. It also required that you run MongoDB (using MongoDB Docker from Community Plugins) in another Docker in my case I named it udi-polyglotv2-MongoDB.
